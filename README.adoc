This python module will help a lot with using python's built-in config parser library. The problem with the default one is that you needed to have known what type of data was coming in for configs and pull it out that way (I.E getint(), getbool()), which is inconvenient. This library solves that by automatically matching the entry in an ini file against regular expressions, and then pulling out the values as the proper data type.
